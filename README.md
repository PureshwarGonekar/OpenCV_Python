# OpenCV

**Computer vision** is a field of artificial intelligence that trains computers to interpret and understand the visual world. Using digital images from cameras and videos and deep learning models, machines can accurately identify and classify objects and then react to what they “see.”

**OpenCV** is a huge open-source library for computer vision, machine learning, and image processing. OpenCV supports a wide variety of programming languages like Python, C++, Java, etc. It can process images and videos to identify objects, faces, or even the handwriting of a human. When it is integrated with various libraries, such as Numpy which is a highly optimized library for numerical operations.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install openCV.

```bash
pip install opencv-python
```
*Note - It will also install numpy module along with it.*
